## Some Basic key Topics that come under DSA
-1.Data structures are broadly categorized into Linear and Non-Linear types. Linear structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues organize elements sequentially, enabling ordered access. Non-linear 
  structures such as trees and graphs are hierarchical or interconnected, offering flexible relationships between elements. Specialized structures like heaps (used for priority tasks) and tries (efficient for 
  string searches) further enhance problem-solving capabilities. Hash-based structures, such as hash tables, provide quick data retrieval using key-value pairs.
-2.Algorithms form the core of problem-solving in DSA. Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort) rearrange elements systematically, while searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search) quickly locate 
  specific items. Graph algorithms (like DFS, BFS, and Dijkstraâ€™s) solve connectivity and pathfinding problems. Dynamic Programming (DP) and Greedy algorithms tackle optimization by breaking problems into smaller 
  parts or making immediate decisions. Techniques like divide-and-conquer and backtracking systematically explore solutions. String algorithms, such as KMP and Rabin-Karp, are optimized for text operations.
-3.Every algorithm is evaluated based on its time complexity (execution speed) and space complexity (memory usage). Common time complexities range from O(1) (constant time) to O(nÂ²) (quadratic time), offering 
  insights into efficiency. Understanding these metrics helps choose the right approach for different scenarios.
